## Introduction

This is a **Rasberry Pi** project for my Data Science for IoT class. It uses a **Sense HAT** to send data to **ThingSpeak8**. I've used a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** and a **Sense HAT** for this project. The **Python** version is **3.9.2**.

## The Idea

During these times the gas prices have risen up so I thought that a **Sense HAT** could be implemented in some way to be useful. My sleeping room is on the third floor while the thermostat is in the living room. My room is pretty cold so if I place my **Raspberry Pi** there, I can adjust the thermostat before I go to my room. I can also keep track of how warm my room is because the readings are uploaded to **ThingSpeak**.
